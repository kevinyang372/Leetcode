# Normal palindrome is defined as a string that reads the same backwards as forwards, for example "abccba".
# Chunked palindrome is defined as a string that you can split into chunks and it will form a palindrome.
# For example, "volvo". You can split it into (vo)(l)(vo). Let A = "vo", B = "l", so the original string is ABA which is a palindrome.

# Given a string str, find the maximum number of chunks we can split that string to get a chuncked palindrome.

# Example 1:

# Input: "valve"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: You can't split it into multiple chunks so just return 1 (valve)
# Example 2:

# Input: "voabcvo"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: (vo)(abc)(vo)
# Example 3:

# Input: "vovo"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: (vo)(vo)
# Example 4:

# Input: "volvolvo"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: (vo)(l)(vo)(l)(vo)
# Example 5:

# Input: "volvol"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: (vol)(vol)
# Example 6:

# Input: "aaaaaa"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: We can split it into (aaa)(aaa), but the optimal split should be (a)(a)(a)(a)(a)(a)
